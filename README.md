## Description

Avarice is a captivating medieval 2D adventure game where players embark on a thrilling journey as a wandering adventurer who stumbles upon a town plagued by monstrous threats. Inspired by the American gold rush era, Avarice delves into themes of ambition, consequence, and the bittersweet pursuit of wealth. The game reflects the historical boom-and-bust cycle, drawing parallels between the gold rush's fleeting prosperity and the rise and fall of the game's central town.

### Origin of the Idea

The concept of Avarice was born from a fascination with the American gold rush of the 1800s. The developers, Nathan Nguyen and Jacob Junker, aimed to capture the essence of this historical period, highlighting both the allure of untold riches and the harsh realities faced by many prospectors. In Avarice, players experience the duality of fortune and downfall, mirroring the experiences of those who chased dreams of wealth only to encounter unforeseen challenges.

### Game Concept

In Avarice, players start as a lone adventurer who, after aiding a besieged merchant caravan, decides to settle in a town under threat. The adventurer's mission is to defend the town, explore treacherous dungeons, gather valuable resources, and ultimately face a deceptive final boss. The gameplay combines elements of combat, exploration, and town management, offering a richly immersive experience.
